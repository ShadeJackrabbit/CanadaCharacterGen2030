CanadaCharacterGen2030
======================

A character generator for making random humans in the year 2030 in Canada

Most of the data used has been compiled from various Statistics Canada site, including directly taken from their site.
I have extrapolated a lot of data to future values, using programs such as Wolfram Mathematica, and libraries like SciPy.

Additional source files will be added later.
